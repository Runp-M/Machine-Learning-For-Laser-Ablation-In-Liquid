List of contets

Folder: 	GA-feature-subset-selection
File:		GA algorithm for feature subselection
Description:	The code implements a genetic algorithm approach for feature selection in machine learning using linear regression as the base model

Folder: 	Voting-regressor
File:		Feature importance ranking
Description:	This code implements the calculation of feature importance of all features by using the dataset of interest fitted in Decision Tree model 
File:		Bayesian optimization
Description:	The code will optimize each model separately using Bayesian Optimization and provide the best parameters and score for each model
File:		Voting regressor with 5 models
Description:	This code utilizes a voting regressor to ensemble five tree-based models, each with optimized hyperparameters, in order to achieve the best predictive capability for the model

Folder: 	Auto-data-splitting-by-article-ID
File: 		Auto data splitting by article ID
Description:	Performs splitting of the database into test and training datasets from distinct sources (article ID)
File:		Bayes_opt + CV by auto datasplitting by article ID
Description:	The code employs Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model on diverse datasets obtained through the 'extract_rows' function of the 'Auto data splitting by article ID.py'
